# Skeleton

Skeletons provide a loading state that mimics the shape of your yet-to-load content.

This "component" is a single constant `Classes.SKELETON` that, when applied to
an element through `className`, will cover its content with a loading animation.
The skeleton inherits the dimensions of whatever element the class is applied
to, so you should supply a placeholder while awaiting real content.

<CssExample name="skeleton" />

## CSS

Apply the class `.@ns-skeleton` to elements that you would like to cover up with
a loading animation.

<Callout intent="warning" title="Manually disable focusable elements">
    When using the `.@ns-skeleton` class on focusable elements such as inputs
    and buttons, be sure to disable the element, via either the `disabled` or
    `tabindex="-1"` attributes. Failing to do so will allow these skeleton
    elements to be focused when they shouldn't be.
</Callout>
