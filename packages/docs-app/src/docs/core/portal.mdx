# Portal

The `Portal` component renders its children into a new "subtree" outside of the current component
hierarchy. It is an essential piece of [`Overlay`](#core/components/overlay), responsible for ensuring that
the overlay contents cover the application below. In most cases you do not need to use a `Portal`
directly; this documentation is provided simply for reference.

## React 15

In a **React 15** environment, `Portal` will use `ReactDOM.unstable_renderSubtreeIntoContainer` to achieve the teleportation effect, which has a few caveats:

1. `Portal` `children` are wrapped in an extra `<div>` inside the portal container element.
1. Test harnesses such as `enzyme` cannot trivially find elements "through" Portals as they're not in the same React tree.
1. React `context` _is_ preserved (this one's a good thing).

In a **React 16+** environment, the `Portal` component will use [`ReactDOM.createPortal`](https://reactjs.org/docs/portals.html) which preserves the React tree perfectly and does not require any of the above caveats.

## React context

`Portal` supports the following options on its [React context](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/context.html).
To use them, supply a child context to a subtree that contains the Portals you want to customize.

<Callout intent="primary">
    Blueprint uses the React 15-compatible <code>getChildContext()</code> API instead of the newer React 16.3 <code>React.createContext()</code> API.

## Props

The `Portal` component functions like a declarative `appendChild()`, or jQuery's
`$.fn.appendTo()`. The children of a `Portal` component are inserted into a new
child of the `<body>`.

`Portal` is used inside [`Overlay`](#core/components/overlay) to actually overlay the content on the
application.

<Callout intent="warning" title="A note about responsive layouts">
    For a single-page app, if the <code>&lt;body></code> is styled with
    <code>width: 100%</code> and <code>height: 100%</code>, a
    <code>Portal</code> may take up extra whitespace and cause the window to
    undesirably scroll. To fix this, instead apply <code>position:
    absolute</code> to the <code>&lt;body></code> tag.
