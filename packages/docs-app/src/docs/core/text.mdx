# Text

The `Text` component adds accessible overflow behavior to a line of text by
conditionally adding the title attribute and truncating with an ellipsis when content overflows its container.

<TextExample />

## Props

`Text` accepts and renders arbitrary children. It is intended that these children render as text.

<Interface name="ITextProps" />
