# Resize sensor

`ResizeSensor` is a component that provides a `"resize"` event for its single
DOM element child. It is a thin wrapper around
[`ResizeObserver`][resizeobserver] to provide React bindings.

[resizeobserver]: https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2016/10/resizeobserver

```tsx
import { IResizeEntry, ResizeSensor } from "@blueprintjs/core";

function handleResize(entries: IResizeEntry[]) {
    console.log(entries.map(e => `${e.contentRect.width} x ${e.contentRect.height}`));
}

<ResizeSensor onResize={handleResize}>
    <div style={{ width: this.props.width }} />
</ResizeSensor>
```

## Props

<Callout intent="warning" title="Asynchronous behavior">
    The `onResize` callback is invoked asynchronously after a resize is detected
    and typically happens at the end of a frame (after layout, before paint).
    Therefore, testing behavior that relies on this component involves setting a
    timeout for the next frame.
</Callout>

<Interface name="IResizeSensorProps" />
