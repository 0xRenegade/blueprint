# Dialog

Dialogs present content overlaid over other parts of the UI.

<Callout intent="primary" title="Terminology note">
    The term "modal" is sometimes used to mean "dialog," but this is a misnomer.
    _Modal_ is an adjective that describes parts of a UI.
    An element is considered modal if it
    [blocks interaction with the rest of the application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_window).
    We use the term "dialog" to avoid confusion with the adjective.

## Props

`Dialog` is a stateless React component controlled by the `isOpen` prop.

The children you provide to this component are rendered as contents inside the
`Classes.DIALOG` element. Typically, you will want to provide a child with
`Classes.DIALOG_BODY` that contains the body content and a child with
`Classes.DIALOG_FOOTER` that contains the action buttons.

<Interface name="IDialogProps" />

## CSS

You can create dialogs manually using the HTML markup and `@ns-dialog-*` classes below.
However, you should use the [`Dialog` component](#core/components/dialog.props)
whenever possible, as they automatically generate some of this markup.

More examples of dialog content are shown below.
