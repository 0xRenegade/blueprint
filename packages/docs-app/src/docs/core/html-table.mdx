# HTML table

This component provides Blueprint styling to native HTML tables.

<Callout intent="primary" title="This is not @blueprintjs/table">
    This table component is a simple CSS-only skin for HTML `&lt;table>` elements.
    It is ideal for basic static tables. If you're looking for more complex
    spreadsheet-like features, check out [**@blueprintjs/table**](#table).
</Callout>

## Props

The `<HTMLTable>` component provides modifier props to apply styles to an HTML
`<table>` element. Note that you are responsible for rendering `<thead>` and
`<tbody>` elements as children.

<Interface name="IHTMLTableProps" />

## CSS

Apply the `@ns-html-table` class to a `<table>` element. You can apply modifiers as additional classes.

<CssExample name="html-table" />
