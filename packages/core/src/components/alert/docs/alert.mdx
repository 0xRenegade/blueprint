# Alert

Alerts notify users of important information and force them to acknowledge the alert content before
continuing.

Although similar to [dialogs](#core/components/dialog), alerts are more
restrictive and should only be used for important information. By default, the
user can only exit the alert by clicking one of the confirmation
buttonsâ€”clicking the overlay or pressing the `esc` key will not close the alert.
These interactions can be enabled via props.

<AlertExample />

## Props

`Alert` only supports controlled usage through the `isOpen` prop. Use the
`onConfirm` and `onCancel` props to respond to those interactions separately, or
use `onClose` to handle both at the same time.

<Interface name="IAlertProps" />
